      note: "Because Salem, MA is such a popular place to visit in the month of October, I highly recommend carpooling or taking an Uber into town.  If you do decide to drive, parking is very difficult every day in October.  Please budget at least twice the travel time that Google Maps supplies when traveling to/from Salem, MA.",

These days it functions as a museum, with tours and (during the month of Halloween) special 'Fright Night' tours.  If you decide to attend one of the special Halloween events, please refer to the Hammon Castle Website for parking information.  Carpooling is recommended.",

      name: "Russell Orchards",
      note: "Located a little out of the way in Ipswich, MA is our favorite orchard.  They bake amazing treats and allow you to choose from apple types you may never have seen before!  If their growing season goes according to plan, you should be able to 'Pick Your Own' apples.  Something really interesting about Russell Orchards is that they are also a winery, and make the most amazing fruit wines.  If you decide to visit, make sure to check their website for tasting times.",

      note: "Gloucester is, at its heart, a small fishing town.  Taking the time for a walk along the water is a lot of fun, and the local restaurants are top-notch."

    {
      name: "Rockport, MA",
      note: "Rockport is very close to Gloucester, and has a strangely named town called 'Bearskin Neck'.  Walking along Main Street and Bearskin Neck you can find small shops with everything from fun, eclectic jewelry to house-made streudel.  Because the town is very close to the water, the weather will likely be a bit colder and windier than other locations.",
