        <p>We wanted to share the most beautiful time of year in New England with all of our family and friends; unfortunately, this means that hotels will fill quickly.  The good news is that there are plenty of local hotels.</p>
        <p>Some hotels that are also in Gloucester include:</p>
        <div className='hotelsList'>
          {hotels}
        </div>
        <p>If you are unable to find a hotel in Gloucester the best local cities to check are:</p>
        <div className='citiesList'>
          {cities}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div className='title'>Things to Do in the Area</div>
        <p>Since we know that most of our invitees will be coming from out of town, you are more than welcome to spend the whole weekend with us!  If you would like to set out on your own, some fun local haunts are:</p>
        <div className='hauntsList'>
          {haunts}
        </div>
      </div>
      <ReturnButton />
    </div>
